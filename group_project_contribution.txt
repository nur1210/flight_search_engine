Here is what I made for the group project up to 13/01/2023

1. Created relational tables with the entities
2. Created the logic in the services and the communication with the controllers between backend and frontend (CRUD operations) for the followings:
		a. Appointments
		b. Applications
		c. Users
		d. Vacancies

3. Unit tests for some of the controllers.
4. Still need to implement 2 features :(
